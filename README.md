📊 Data Science Project Overview

In this data science project, we delve into the thrilling world of T20 World Cup cricket, combining the power of Python's Pandas for data cleaning and Microsoft's Power BI for visualization. The project revolves around four key datasets: t20_wc_batting_summary, t20_wc_bowling_summary, t20_wc_match_results, and t20_wc_player_info, each offering unique insights into players' performances and match outcomes.

🔍 Data Cleaning with Pandas

The journey begins with meticulous data cleaning using Pandas, as we tackle the challenge of harmonizing information from three distinct file formats: JSON and CSV. Through Pandas' versatile functionality, we wrangle and refine the datasets, ensuring consistency and reliability in preparation for analysis.

🏏 Datasets Overview:

t20_wc_batting_summary: This dataset encapsulates batting statistics, offering a comprehensive view of players' performances at the crease.

t20_wc_bowling_summary: Delving into the art of bowling, this dataset provides valuable insights into bowlers' prowess and effectiveness during T20 World Cup matches.

t20_wc_match_results: With match results at its core, this dataset paints a vivid picture of the dynamic outcomes and thrilling encounters witnessed throughout the T20 World Cup.

t20_wc_player_info: Providing background information on players, this dataset enriches our analysis by contextualizing performances within individual player profiles.

📈 Visualization with Power BI

Armed with clean and refined data, we harness the visualization capabilities of Power BI to breathe life into our insights. From interactive dashboards to insightful charts, Power BI transforms raw data into compelling narratives, empowering stakeholders to glean actionable insights and make informed decisions.
